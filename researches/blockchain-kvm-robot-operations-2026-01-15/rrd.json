Collects detailed 5G RAN parameters (Accuver XCAL) plus application logs/Wireshark to correlate per-frame delays with CQI, BLER, handovers, and RB allocation; evaluates video compression (H.264/H.265/VP8/VP9) and QoE adaptation behavior (WebRTC GCC).",

H.265+RTSP reduces >100ms total-delay violations to 0.487% but still has 17% of frames with network delay >45ms. Multi-camera streaming worsens tail behavior (e.g., RTSP merged cameras: 13% frames violate 100ms total delay and 45% violate 45ms network delay). 64-beam LiDAR streaming is effectively infeasible over 5G (median network delay ~2s even with voxel downsampling; raw ~6s). Downlink C&C is comparatively feasible (median 17.29ms; 64.29% within application target and 37.20% within network target). Cross-layer attribution: poor CQI raises average per-frame network delay from ~0.40s to ~0.77s (+92.5%); high BLER (10%+) raises delay from ~0.61s to ~0.95s (+55.7%); during A3 handovers delay increases ~86%, and ping-pong handovers can increase delay 56–85%. WebRTC bitrate adaptation lags ~10s behind sudden PHY throughput drops due to slower RTCP feedback (>=2s) versus fast 5G dynamics, motivating 5G-aware adaptation and multi-operator switching (example keeps per-frame total delay mostly <100ms).",

A terrain-adaptation module builds an onboard elevation map and reprojects unsafe footsteps to nearby planar regions, demonstrated on the Nadia humanoid on flat ground and a cinder-block hill.",
        "methodology": "VR ankle trackers drive step detection (horizontal displacement + vertical lift thresholds). Instantaneous step direction is computed from tracker displacement; stride length is predicted using measured displacement + average horizontal velocity and blended back to the measured displacement using a landing factor derived from vertical motion (z and ż), then smoothed with a P-update and clamped. Footsteps are mapped into the robot stance frame with kinematic/yaw constraints. For terrain, a GPU pipeline constructs a quasi-global elevation map from depth sensing (local extraction + global fusion), and a GPU grid-search optimizer scores candidate foot poses with a composite cost emphasizing planarity/continuity. Execution uses a momentum-based whole-body QP walking controller with a standing/transfer/swing state machine and ICP-based balance; swing trajectories are modified with waypoints for step-up/step-down clearance.",

A consortium validator cluster (Proof-of-Authority) maintains blockchain state and endorses hub-signed permissions via BFT consensus (Ditto, a 2-chain HotStuff variant); validators also keep indices + an in-memory shadow copy of latest policies to avoid reconstructing policies from transaction logs during validation. Access flow: users request (uid,did,pt,sv) from the hub; hub checks policy, signs a token, and (full path) waits for validator endorsement before distributing a session key to the device. Shortcut: for a trusted-user list Tu, the hub sends token + session key immediately and submits endorsement to validators in parallel; the design also supports intranet-only operation during Internet disconnection with later synchronization.",
