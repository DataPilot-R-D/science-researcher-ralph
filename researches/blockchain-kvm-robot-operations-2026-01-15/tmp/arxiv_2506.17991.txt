Abstract—Telerobotics is a key foundation in autonomous
Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS), enabling remote op-
erations across various domains. However, conventional cloud-
based telerobotics suffers from latency, reliability, scalability,
and resilience issues, hindering real-time performance in critical
applications. Cloud-Fog Telerobotics (CFTel) builds on the Cloud-
Fog Automation (CFA) paradigm to address these limitations
by leveraging a distributed Cloud-Edge-Robotics computing
architecture, enabling deterministic connectivity, deterministic
connected intelligence, and deterministic networked computing.
This paper synthesizes recent advancements in CFTel, aiming to
highlight its role in facilitating scalable, low-latency, autonomous,
and AI-driven telerobotics. We analyze architectural frameworks
and technologies that enable them, including 5G Ultra-Reliable
Low-Latency Communication, Edge Intelligence, Embodied AI,
and Digital Twins. The study demonstrates that CFTel has the
potential to enhance real-time control, scalability, and autonomy
while supporting service-oriented solutions. We also discuss prac-
tical challenges, including latency constraints, cybersecurity risks,
interoperability issues, and standardization efforts. This work
serves as a foundational reference for researchers, stakeholders,
and industry practitioners in future telerobotics research.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Telerobotics is a critical application of next-generation
Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS), enabling remote
control of robotic systems in complex environments within
Industry 4.0 [1]–[5]. Conventional cloud-based telerobotics,
which relies on centralized processing, faces significant la-
tency and network congestion, limiting real-time performance
in critical applications of industrial automation [5], [6]. Cloud-
Fog Automation (CFA) is a new paradigm that addresses these
challenges by integrating a distributed Cloud-Edge-Robotics
architecture with deterministic networking. It incorporates
Edge Intelligence (EI), Embodied AI (EAI), and Digital
Twins (DTs) to deliver scalable, low-latency, autonomous,
and intelligent telerobotic systems [7], [8]. This framework
leverages the combined capabilities of Cloud-Fog computing,
which emphasizes deterministic communication, computing,
and control, alongside scalable, service-oriented solutions [6].
Leveraging the dynamic and network-centric features of
CFA, Cloud-Fog Telerobotics (CFTel) enhances conventional
telerobotics by distributing computational workloads across
cloud, edge, and robotics layers [4], [9]. The cloud layer
supports big data analytics, AI model deployment, and multi-
robot coordination. While edge nodes enable low-latency AI
inference, time-sensitive operations, and decentralized alloca-
tion of computing load using fog computing, the robotics layer,
powered by EAI, ensures autonomous adaptation to dynamic
environments [7], [10]. Deterministic networking technolo-
gies, such as 5G Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication
(URLLC) and Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), underpin
real-time control, ensuring high-reliability networks [11], [12].
These advancements facilitate applications in smart manufac-
turing, agriculture, logistics, automated warehousing, health-
care, and disaster management, supporting service-oriented
models that enhance scalability and flexibility in Industry 4.0.
Despite technological advancements, CFTel faces chal-
lenges, including latency constraints, cybersecurity risks, in-
teroperability issues, and scalability limitations, necessitating
standardized architectures and robust AI-driven frameworks
[13]. This paper synthesizes recent advancements to empower
CFTel, highlighting its role in enabling scalable, low-latency,
autonomous, and AI-driven telerobotics. In summary, we make
the following contributions:
• Review state-of-the-art enabling technologies for teler-
obotics, focusing on EI, EAI, and DTs.
• Propose a novel Cloud-Fog Telerobotics architecture
based on the Cloud-Fog Automation.
• Outline challenges and future research directions for AI-
driven control systems to enhance robust telerobotics.
This paper is structured as follows: Section II presents the
CFTel architecture, Section III details technologies, Section IV
describes industrial applications, Section V addresses practical
challenges, and Section VI concludes with future directions.
II. C LOUD -FOG TELEROBOTICS ARCHITECTURE
CFTel employs a hierarchical Cloud-Edge-Robotics archi-
tecture to distribute computational and operational workloads,
ensuring deterministic communication, computing, and con-
trol [4], [14]. Table I compares the limitations of conven-
tional cloud-based telerobotics with the proposed architecture

by integrating distributed, decentralized, and localized pro-
cessing. This approach enables computational load balanc-
ing, time-sensitive decision-making, security, scalability, and
resilience for AI-driven telerobotics. It also enhances real-
time performance, resilience, and scalability, and supports
service-oriented solutions such as Robots-as-a-Service (RaaS),
Control-as-a-Service (CaaS), and Manufacturing-as-a-Service
(MaaS) [6]. Figure 1 illustrates the overall architecture of
CFTel, and each layer plays a key role as follows:
• Cloud Layer: Centralizes high-level processing for ICPS
analytics, AI development and training, and multi-robot
coordination, enabling MaaS and RaaS.
• Edge Layer: Enables low-latency decision-making, AI
inference for time-sensitive operations, supporting CaaS.
• Robotics Layer: Provides ultra-low-latency control, re-
silience, and autonomy with EAI for telerobotics in ICPS.
A. Cloud Layer
The cloud layer serves as the centralized hub for high-level
processing, providing extensive data storage, big data analyt-
ics, and large-scale AI model training. It facilitates global
intelligence through tasks such as predictive maintenance,
multi-robot task allocation, and fleet-wide optimization. The
cloud supports scalable, vendor-independent models such as
MaaS, enabling seamless integration of heterogeneous robotic
systems [6], [8], [10]. It also hosts DTs, virtual replicas
of physical systems, for real-time simulation and diagnos-
tics [15], which are critical for applications such as precision
agriculture [16]. However, reliance on remote data centers
introduces latency, limiting its suitability for time-critical tasks
such as telerobotic surgery or disaster response. The cloud
layer interfaces with lower layers to delegate time-sensitive
operations, ensuring balanced workload distribution [6].
B. Edge Layer
The edge layer enables low-latency decision-making and
AI inference by processing data closer to robotic systems.
Deployed in industrial environments, edge nodes execute
lightweight AI models for time-sensitive tasks, including qual-
ity inspection, path planning, system failure detection, and data
encryption [17], [18]. This layer incorporates fog computing
principles, often referred to as EI, which reduces cloud depen-
dency, enhances security, and optimizes bandwidth [8]. Edge
computing supports CaaS, enabling modular control services
for commercial applications. By distributing computational
loads across multiple edge nodes, this layer enhances network
reliability and resilience, particularly in dynamic environments
where cloud connectivity may be intermittent [13]. Tradi-
tional time-sensitive control functions, typically managed by
Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), can be migrated
to the Edge Layer using EI. EI can execute control logic
with AI-driven models, such as reinforcement learning for
adaptive control, while leveraging TSN and 5G URLLC to en-
sure deterministic performance with sub-millisecond response
times [14]. However, challenges include adapting legacy PLC
code to AI-based systems, which requires careful validation
to maintain reliability and safety in industrial settings [7].
C. Robotics Layer
The robotics layer delivers ultra-low-latency execution, uti-
lizing EAI for real-time robotic control and autonomy [1].
Comprising physical robotic systems, this layer processes
sensor inputs, such as LiDAR, cameras, and haptic feedback,
to enable millisecond-level responses [17]. EAI empowers
robots to perceive, learn, and adapt to dynamic environments.
This layer enhances resilience through localized intelligence,
minimizing dependency on upper layers [4], [8]. The integra-
tion with edge nodes ensures seamless data flow, supporting
scalable autonomous solutions, such as RaaS and CaaS.
D. Integration with Existing Industrial Systems
Integrating CFTel architecture into existing industrial sys-
tems is critical for practical deployment in Industry 4.0.
Legacy systems, such as PLCs and Supervisory Control and
Data Acquisition systems, can be interfaced with CFTel us-
ing OPC Unified Architecture (OPC-UA). OPC-UA enables
seamless data exchange between legacy systems and CFTel’s
Edge and Cloud layers, ensuring compatibility and real-
time monitoring [3], [19]. Additionally, middleware solutions

abstract the underlying complexities of heterogeneous sys-
tems, providing a unified interface for data aggregation and
control. This approach ensures that CFTel can be incremen-
tally adopted in existing industrial setups without requir-
ing a complete overhaul.
E. Performance Evaluation Approach
To assess CFTel’s practical relevance, performance evalua-
tion can focus on key metrics such as latency, throughput, and
reliability. Latency, as shown in Table I, is reduced to 5-10 ms
in CFTel compared to 50-100 ms in conventional cloud-based
telerobotics. Throughput can be measured by the number of
robotic tasks processed per second, while reliability can be
evaluated through the percentage of successful task comple-
tions under varying network conditions. A simulation-based
approach using tools such as NS-3 or OMNeT++ can model
CFTel’s architecture in real-world applications such as multi-
robot coordination in logistics or networked robotic systems
in smart manufacturing for validating CFTel’s advantages.
III. E NABLING TECHNOLOGIES FOR CFT EL
The implementation of CFTel relies on advanced tech-
nologies that ensure deterministic communication, real-time
computing, and intelligent control. This section examines
three critical enabling technologies: Network Infrastructure,
EI and EAI, and DTs. These technologies underpin the hier-
archical architectural layers, facilitating scalable, low-latency,
and autonomous telerobotic operations. By integrating these
technologies, CFTel achieves deterministic performance and
service-oriented solutions as presented in Table II.
A. Network Infrastructure
A robust network infrastructure serves as the backbone of
CFTel, providing deterministic, low-latency communication.
Several advanced technologies contribute to this framework:
• Time-Sensitive Networking: TSN extends Ethernet to
ensure deterministic data transmission with minimal jitter,
which is critical for synchronized operations [1], [7].
• 5G and Beyond: 5G deliver ultra-low-latency and high-
reliability communication, supporting long-distance teler-
obotics. Emerging 6G promises further reductions in
latency, ideal for time-sensitive applications [4], [5], [12].
• Wi-Fi 6/7: These standards offer high throughput, low
latency, and improved performance, complementing 5G
and TSN by enhancing wireless connectivity, reducing
congestion, and supporting real-time data exchange [7].
B. Edge Intelligence and Embodied AI

leveraging fog-edge computing for low-latency inference and
enabling adaptive, resilient telerobotic systems across ICPS
applications [2], [5], [8].
• Edge Intelligence: EI deploys AI models at edge nodes,
processing data locally to minimize latency and reduce
cloud dependency. Convolutional Neural Networks can be
deployed for time-sensitive tasks such as quality inspec-
tion and system predictive maintenance. Federated learn-
ing enables decentralized model training across edge,
preserving privacy and improving efficiency [20], [21].
• Embodied AI: EAI integrates AI into physical sys-
tems, enabling perception, learning, and adaptation [11].
Through sensor fusion and reinforcement learning, EAI
facilitates adaptive autonomy, allowing robots to optimize
and perform complex tasks with minimal human input
while enhancing human-robot interaction [22], [23].
C. Digital Twins
DTs are virtual representations of physical robotic systems,
mirroring their real-time state and behavior to optimize perfor-
mance and reliability in CFTel. Hosted primarily in the cloud
or edge layers, DTs integrate data from robotics and edge
nodes to provide real-time insights [15], [22]. Data manage-
ment employs a publish-subscribe model, such as MQTT, en-
suring efficient real-time updates with minimal overhead [11].
• Predictive Maintenance: DTs analyze historical and
real-time data to predict potential failures, enabling proac-
tive maintenance scheduling to minimize downtime.
• System Optimization: DTs facilitate simulation, testing,
and optimization of robotic configurations, enabling pa-
rameter refinement before real-world deployment.
• Remote Diagnostics and Monitoring: DTs allow op-
erators to visualize robot states and detect anomalies
remotely via immersive eXtended Reality interfaces.

smart manufacturing and agriculture, logistics and warehous-
ing, healthcare, and disaster management, detailing specific
use cases, benefits, and challenges as presented in Table III.
Each subsection highlights the enabling technologies that drive
innovation and support service-oriented solutions.

The distributed CFTel architecture advances smart manufac-
turing by enabling adaptive automation, remote monitoring,
and predictive maintenance in advanced autonomous ICPS.
Cloud-based AI analyzes sensor data to predict equipment
failures, reducing factory downtime and executing high-level
decision-making [4]. Robotic arms in automotive assembly
lines use fog computing for real-time quality inspection,
detecting defects instantly to minimize waste. Edge nodes
empower robots with adaptive control, allowing immediate
responses to production anomalies, thus enhancing operational
efficiency and cost-effectiveness. These capabilities ensure
high reliability, scalability, and resilience, supporting MaaS,
RaaS, and CaaS for vendor-independent deployments [1], [18].
In agriculture, CFTel facilitates precision farming through
autonomous drones and robots powered by EI and EAI [17],
[24]. These systems perform tasks such as pest detection, crop
monitoring, and soil analysis, processing data locally to opti-
mize yields in real time [13]. Drones equipped with LiDAR

processing [16]. CFTel’s architecture enhances scalability, en-
abling farmers to manage large fields efficiently. Challenges in-
clude integrating heterogeneous robotic systems and ensuring
robust connectivity in rural areas, necessitating standardized
protocols and advanced networking solutions [10].
B. Logistics and Warehousing
CFTel transforms logistics and warehousing by enabling
real-time coordination of autonomous robotic fleets, boosting
efficiency and throughput [25]. The cloud layer optimizes
fleet-wide operations using AI-driven algorithms, while edge
nodes handle localized tasks. Leveraging 5G URLLC, robots
dynamically navigate for sub-millisecond coordination with
other robots and workers, enhancing safety and speed [7]. DTs
simulate warehouse workflows, predicting bottlenecks and op-
timizing layouts, further improving operational efficiency [15].
CFTel’s distributed architecture supports CaaS, allowing
modular control services for scalable logistics operations [6].
The communication paradigm of CFTel, combined with EI, en-
sures robots adapt to dynamic environments. This architecture
inherently supports scalability by offloading computational
tasks to edge nodes, reducing bottlenecks in high-density
robotic networks. Technologies such as 5G URLLC and EI en-

vestigation into network capacity and swarm intelligence [25].
C. Healthcare
In healthcare, CFTel enables robotic-assisted surgery and
assistive robotics, addressing the demand for remote interven-
tions and patient support. CFTel facilitates real-time data pro-
cessing to guide complex surgical procedures, incorporating
advanced health technologies such as the Da Vinci Surgical
System, and enhances surgical precision and dexterity [26],
[27]. Fog computing ensures low-latency control, critical for
maintaining accuracy during telerobotic surgeries, achieving
sub-millisecond response times [7]. Assistive robots are de-
ployed in elderly care and rehabilitation for health monitoring
and personalized mobility support in a time-sensitive manner.
CFTel’s distributed architecture enables scalable healthcare
solutions and supports RaaS for broad deployment [6], [27].
However, challenges, including data privacy, cybersecurity,
and regulatory compliance, present significant obstacles. Se-
cure, privacy-preserving architectures are crucial to safeguard
sensitive patient data while ensuring operational efficiency,
prompting research into blockchain-based security and stan-
dardized protocols for healthcare robotics [26], [27].
D. Disaster Management
CFTel is pivotal in disaster management, where swarm
robotics performs search-and-rescue missions in hazardous en-
vironments. Cloud-fog computing enables real-time informa-
tion sharing and coordination, while decentralized AI models
at edge nodes facilitate autonomous decision-making [18].
Robots deployed in earthquake-affected areas navigate using
EAI, coordinating via 5G to locate survivors. DTs monitor
robot states remotely, allowing operators to optimize mission
strategies through immersive interfaces [22], [23]. These ca-
pabilities enhance responsiveness in unpredictable disasters.
Challenges include achieving robust inter-robot communi-
cation under limited bandwidth and ensuring resilience in dis-
rupted networks [4], [7]. Future advancements in 6G network-
ing, decentralized AI, and EAI are expected to improve swarm
robotics efficiency, enabling more autonomous and scalable
disaster response systems. CFTel’s integration of distributed
intelligence and deterministic communication positions it as a
critical technology for life-saving operations.

V. P RACTICAL CHALLENGES
CFTel offers transformative potential for autonomous ICPS,
but significant challenges hinder its widespread adoption.
These obstacles span technical performance, security, and
system interoperability, impacting the reliability, safety, and
scalability of telerobotic applications. This section examines
three critical challenges, details the implications, and pro-
poses solutions to empower CFTel’s integration into various
domains. Addressing these challenges is essential to realizing
the promise of deterministic, autonomous, and service-oriented
solutions through CFTel architecture.
A. Latency and Real-Time Constraints
Achieving ultra-low latency and deterministic real-time
communication is a formidable challenge for implementing
CFTel, particularly in time-critical applications such as teler-
obotic surgery [5], [26] and multi-robot coordination in disas-
ter response [6]. Although sub-millisecond response times are
essential to ensure precision and safety, network congestion,
jitter, and packet loss often introduce unacceptable delays [7].
TSN provides deterministic Ethernet-based transmission,
while 5G URLLC achieves approximately 1 ms latency with
99.999% reliability [14]. Wi-Fi 6/7 further enhance through-
put in dense environments [12]. However, these technologies
struggle under dynamic conditions, such as fluctuating network
loads in logistics hubs. AI-powered network orchestration
can prioritize critical data streams, while latency-aware edge
processing offloads computations to edge nodes, reducing
transmission delays [9], [18]. Adaptive scheduling models
enhance responsiveness by predicting congestion. Emerging
6G networks, AI-orchestrated network slicing, and Quantum
Internet promise further improvements, but their development
remains nascent, requiring further research.
B. Cybersecurity
The CFTel architecture introduces cybersecurity risks, as
data and control signals traverse multiple layers, exposing
vulnerabilities to threats such as man-in-the-middle attacks,
adversarial AI, and ransomware. Unauthorized access to teler-
obotic systems could disrupt operations and compromise sensi-
tive data, with severe consequences in critical applications. For
example, a breach in a surgical robot endangers patients [26],
while compromised logistics robots disrupt supply chains [18].
Traditional security measures are vital, but they introduce
latency and conflict with advanced requirements. Advanced
solutions, such as blockchain-based authentication and zero-
trust security models, offer robust protection but incur compu-
tational overhead. In multi-agent robotic systems, establishing
trust among robots is complex, necessitating decentralized
security models that verify authenticity without centralized
reliance [18]. An AI-driven anomaly detection system can
monitor behavior in real time, identifying unusual patterns
indicative of attacks [2]. As quantum computing advances,
quantum-resistant cryptographic techniques are needed to safe-
guard against future threats [1]. Developing lightweight, low-
latency security protocols is critical to balance protection and
performance in CFTel for autonomous ICPS.
C. Standardization
The absence of standardized frameworks and protocols
poses a major barrier to the scalability and interoperability of
CFTel. Proprietary architectures and communication protocols
prevalent in industries lead to compatibility issues, complicat-
ing the integration of robotic systems from different vendors.
This fragmentation hinders efficient data exchange and real-
time collaboration, limiting the adoption of CFTel.
Interoperability challenges are particularly pronounced be-
tween open-source platforms and proprietary systems, which
often use different data formats and communication protocols.
For example, ROS relies on a publish-subscribe model, while
proprietary systems may use custom APIs, leading to inte-
gration bottlenecks. In practice, protocols such as ROS [13],
OPC-UA [3], and Message Queuing Telemetry Transport
(MQTT) [11] provide partial solutions but lack a unified
architecture to integrate diverse robotic platforms, networking
infrastructures, and AI-driven systems. A potential solution is
integrating ROS 2 with OPC-UA to bridge robotic and indus-
trial systems. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Net-
work Function Virtualization (NFV) further address these chal-
lenges by providing a flexible network layer that abstracts the
differences between heterogeneous systems, enabling seamless
data exchange and control [12]. Standardization efforts by
IEEE, ISO, and IEC are ongoing, but inconsistent adoption
persists. Universal middleware solutions that abstract underly-
ing complexities can ensure semantic interoperability.

VI. C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
This state-of-the-art review has comprehensively explored
CFTel and its pivotal role in advancing ICPS. By leveraging
CFA, CFTel overcomes the limitations of conventional cloud-
based telerobotics, delivering deterministic communication,
computing, and control through the Cloud-Edge-Robotics ar-
chitecture. The review details enabling technologies, including
TSN, 5G URLLC, Wi-Fi 6/7, EI, EAI, and DTs.
CFTel impact spans diverse applications, including adaptive
automation in smart manufacturing and precision farming in
agriculture, to efficient robotic fleets in logistics and ware-
housing, precise interventions in healthcare, and resilient op-
erations in disaster management. Despite these advancements,
challenges such as latency, cybersecurity, and standardization
persist, necessitating innovative solutions to ensure reliability
and scalability. This paper serves as a foundational resource
for researchers and industry professionals, synthesizing recent
advancements and providing a roadmap for future innovation
in telerobotics, thereby contributing to the evolution of au-
tonomous and intelligent industrial automation.
Further research is required to fully leverage CFTel’s poten-
tial, address existing constraints, and utilize emerging techno-
logical advancements to facilitate next-generation autonomous
and secure industrial systems. Key directions include AI-
driven time-sensitive operations, deterministic networking,
sustainable distributed computing paradigms, advancements in
EI and EAI, cybersecurity and privacy solutions, standardiza-
tion and interoperability, and application-specific challenges.
