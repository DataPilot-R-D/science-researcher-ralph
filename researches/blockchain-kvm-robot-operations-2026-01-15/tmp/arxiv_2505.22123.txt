Abstract—As immersive eXtended Reality (XR) applications
demand substantial network resources, understanding their
interaction with 5G networks becomes crucial to improve
them. This paper investigates the role of 5G physical-layer
monitoring to manage and enhance the remote rendering of
XR content dynamically. By observing network metrics directly
from the physical layer, we propose a system to adapt streaming
parameters such as bitrate, framerate, and resolution in real time
based on available network capacity. Using theoretical formulas
to estimate maximum data rate, our approach evaluates network
resource availability, enabling the renderer to self-adjust media
content representation. This is critical for providing consistent
and smooth XR experiences to users, especially as network
conditions fluctuate. Our findings suggest that physical-layer
monitoring offers valuable insights to increase the Quality of
Service (QoS) and has the potential to elevate user experience in
remote-rendered XR applications.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Extended Reality (XR), encompassing Virtual Reality (VR)
and Augmented Reality (AR), is revolutionizing how users
interact with digital environments. These technologies enable
immersive experiences that blend the physical and digital
worlds, offering applications in gaming, education, healthcare,
and beyond. However, the resource-intensive nature of XR
poses significant challenges, particularly when rendering
complex content in real time. High-fidelity XR applications
require substantial computational power to generate realistic
3D environments and process interactions at low latency.
While some XR devices, such as high-end PCs or gaming
consoles, can handle local rendering, many XR applications
rely on remote rendering—offloading the computational
workload to external servers or Multi-access Edge Computing
(MEC) nodes. This approach enables lightweight XR devices,
such as standalone headsets or mobile devices, to access high-
quality experiences without the need for expensive onboard
hardware. However, remote rendering introduces a strong
dependency on network performance, as the rendered frames
must be streamed in real time to the XR device with minimal
latency.
Remotely rendered high-quality XR experiences depend
on ultralow latency, high bandwidth, and consistent network
performance, making the interplay between XR applications
and network infrastructure a critical research area [1]. The
advent of 5G networks, with their reduced latency capabilities
and enhanced bandwidth, has created new opportunities for
streaming remote-rendered XR content efficiently [2]. Despite
these advancements, network conditions in 5G environments
can still fluctuate due to factors such as user mobility, network
congestion, and environmental interferences. These factors can
degrade both Quality of Experience (QoE) and the Quality
of Service (QoS), manifesting as delays, lower resolution, or
disrupted interactions.
Addressing this challenge requires a deeper understanding
of the network behavior and adaptive mechanisms that can
respond in real time to changes in network conditions [3]. This
paper explores the potential of leveraging 5G physical-layer
monitoring to tap into metrics such as signal strength, channel
quality, and available bandwidth. By estimating network
resource availability, XR streaming systems can dynamically
adjust parameters such as bitrate, framerate, and resolution
to enhance performance, ensuring a smooth and immersive
experience.
The contributions of this paper are as follows:
• Utilizing physical layer monitoring to estimate available
network resources: The paper demonstrates how
monitoring specific metrics from the 5G network’s
physical layer, along with theoretical formulas to
calculate data rate, can provide an accurate estimate
of available network resources. This estimation allows
the system to notice changes in connection quality
and adjust to maintain a stable user experience in XR
environments.
• Evaluation of the impact of adaptability on QoS:
Through comparing the results to the ones obtained
when no adaptability is implemented, this paper evaluates
how auto-adaptation based on network resources can
enhance the user experience by improving performance
and reducing streaming issues in XR experiences. The
research provides data on how controlling rendering
quality parameters can significantly contribute to
consistent QoS in variable connection scenarios.

system is described in section IV. Section V details the

II. R ELATED WORK
The convergence of XR technologies and 5G networks
has become a critical research area in recent years. Several
studies [4], [5], [6] have explored the unique challenges
associated with delivering immersive XR experiences over 5G,
focusing on network latency, bandwidth demands, and QoS.
These works highlight the importance of developing adaptive
mechanisms to address fluctuations in network conditions and
ensure seamless user experiences.
Research on 5G networks has emphasized their potential
to support low-latency, high-bandwidth applications. Authors
in [7] have highlighted how 5G and 6G architectures can
be leveraged to mitigate latency issues for XR, enabling
interactive and immersive applications. However, this work
also identifies challenges such as user mobility, which can
disrupt the reliability of XR streaming.
The role of adaptive streaming systems in XR has also
been the focus of several studies. Studies such as [8]
and [9] investigated AI/ML-driven solutions for dynamic
resource allocation in XR applications, showcasing the benefits
of predictive models for real-time adjustments in bitrate
and resolution. Similarly, in [10] a loopback mechanism
is proposed to monitor and optimize network performance,
demonstrating its ability to enhance QoS under fluctuating
conditions.
Other contributions, like [11] have explored how XR-aware
next-generation networks, spanning from the physical layer
to the applications, enable the optimization and resource
allocation to meet the demanding QoS requirements of XR
services.
Despite these advancements, most solutions rely on general
optimization frameworks, leaving a gap in XR-specific
strategies that integrate physical-layer insights into adaptive
streaming.
While the current body of research addresses critical
aspects of XR performance over 5G, significant challenges
remain. Many existing solutions lack scalability for dense
user environments or fail to account for the variability of
5G networks in mobile scenarios. Moreover, few studies have
explicitly focused on leveraging physical-layer monitoring to
predict resource availability in real time.
This paper builds upon these studies by proposing a novel
approach that utilizes physical-layer metrics to enhance XR
streaming systems. It focuses on calculating the theoretical
maximum data rate of a given system based on 5G wireless
networks. By leveraging this data rate estimation, the proposed
approach enables XR systems to dynamically adapt streaming
parameters in response to real-time network conditions. By
bridging the gap between network-level data and real-time
adaptation, the proposed method offers a more robust solution
for maintaining high QoE in dynamic 5G environments. This
contribution addresses the limitations of prior work and paves
the way for more reliable and immersive XR experiences.
III. P HYSICAL LAYER -DRIVEN BANDWIDTH ESTIMATION
In several 3GPP releases, different network components,
e.g., Network Exposure Function (NEF) [12], are standardized
to provide access to network information such as
configurations and metrics. Accessing such information
enables any application to estimate the current network
capacity and improve its behavior. Moreover, [13] includes
the specifications of the radio access capabilities required
for 5G User Equipment (UE) to operate in 5G NR (New
Radio) networks. Among others, it describes how to calculate
the maximum theoretical data rates for both downlink
(DL) and uplink (UL), considering modulation, coding
schemes, physical resource blocks (PRBs), and network
overhead. The document provides configurations for channels
and carriers, including the number of PRBs available for
different bandwidths and subcarrier spacing. It also defines
requirements for modulation orders and coding efficiency. This
specification plays a critical role in ensuring interoperability
between devices and networks while guiding manufacturers,
operators, and researchers in the development and deployment
of 5G technologies.
According to the mentioned specification, the maximum
data rate of a 5G network for a user can be calculated using
the following equation:
Data Rate (Mbps) = 10−6 ·
JX
j=1

v(j)
Layers · Q(j)
m · f(j) · Rmax·
NBW (j),µ
PRB · 12
Tµ
s
· (1 − OH(j))

(1)
The parameters presented in the formula are:
• J: Number of aggregated component carriers in a band
or band combination.
• v(j)
Layers: Number of transmission layers for carrier j.
• Q(j)
m : Modulation order for carrier j, i.e., bits per symbol.
E.g., 2 for Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK), 4 for
16 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (16-QAM), etc.
• f(j): The scaling factor. It can take the values 1, 0.8, 0.75
and 0.4.
• Rmax: Maximum code rate (e.g., Rmax = 948
1024 ).
• NBW (j),µ
PRB : Number of PRBs available for carrier j in the
given bandwidth BW and numerology µ.
• Tµ
s : Symbol duration in seconds, which depends on the
subcarrier spacing (e.g., for ∆f = 15 kHz, Ts = 71.4 µs).
• OH(j): Overhead for carrier j, representing the fraction
of resources not used for data (e.g., OH = 0 .14 for
frequency range FR1 for DL).

Fig. 1: Architecture for auto-adaptive XR Remote Rendering.
The information derived from the equation can be
directly applied to a content streaming system with adaptive
bitrate mechanisms. By periodically calculating the maximum
theoretical data rate available on the 5G channel, the system
can dynamically select the most suitable streaming profile
based on current network conditions.
IV. A DAPTIVE REMOTE RENDERING FOR XR
Figure 1 shows the general architecture of an auto-adaptive
XR Remote Rendering system. It consists of two main
modules: the Rate Controller and the XR Remote Renderer.
The Rate Controller is responsible for collecting network
metrics and conducting bandwidth estimations that are going
to be the input for the XR Remote Renderer to adapt the
content streaming. Then, an XR Client receives the rendered
media content through the 5G network.
The communication between the various components of
the system is illustrated in Figure 2. The process of
physic layer monitoring and the streaming quality profile
updating is performed in a continuous loop. This cycle
begins with the Rate Controller requesting the Modulation
and Coding Scheme (MCS) index from the 5G gNB (1).
The MCS index in a 5G network is a mechanism that
determines how data is transmitted efficiently by combining
modulation techniques and forward error correction coding
rates. Modulation defines how digital bits are mapped to
symbols, such as QPSK, 16-QAM, or 256-QAM, while the
coding scheme adds redundancy to protect the data against
errors. The MCS is dynamically adjusted based on the quality
of the wireless channel; when conditions are favorable, higher-
order modulation and lower redundancy allow for faster
data rates, whereas in poor channel conditions, lower-order
modulation with higher redundancy ensures more reliable
communication, but reduce the achieved data rate. Upon
receiving the MCS index, the Rate Controller estimates the
wireless channel bandwidth using Equation 1 (2). If necessary,
it communicates with the XR Remote Renderer to adjust the
streaming quality profile (3). The XR Remote Renderer then
updates the content streaming configuration accordingly (4).
Concurrently, the XR Client receives the rendered video and
audio streams and sends interaction data back to the XR
Remote Renderer (5). Additionally, the XR Client exports
performance-related metrics for further analysis (6). To prevent
an excessive number of requests for quality changes to
Fig. 2: Sequence diagram.
the XR Remote Renderer, a limit of one change every
three seconds has been applied. This mechanism helps avoid
unnecessary switching in scenarios where the channel quality
fluctuates slightly above and below the predefined thresholds.
By imposing this restriction, the system ensures stability and
prevents rapid oscillations between streaming quality profiles
due to minor, short-term variations in network conditions.
Three predefined streaming quality profiles are configured
for the XR service, each defined by resolution, frame rate
and bitrate [14] as described in Table I. The maximum data
rate calculated every second determines the selected streaming
quality profile, enabling the adaptation of the XR rendering
quality to the available network capacity in real-time. The data
rate ranges have been assigned to each quality profile taking
into account the overhead that the RTP protocol adds to the
data transmission [15].

V. E XPERIMENTAL ASSESSMENT
A. Testbed setup
To evaluate the theoretical data rate estimation and its
impact on QoS in 5G networks, a testbed has been set up
using the Amarisoft platform [16] to create a standalone 5G
network. The Amarisoft software generates the 5G network,
including both the core and radio access network (RAN) and
provides detailed logs that include key network parameters.
It has been configured with a specific network setup tailored
to the requirements of the study. This configuration provides
a controlled environment to evaluate the proposed methods
effectively. The network parameters established in Amarisoft
have been subsequently utilized to complete the bandwidth
estimation equation. The key parameters of the testbed are
listed in Table II.
TABLE II: Values used in the formula for Data Rate
Calculation.
Number of Carriers ( J) 1
Number of Layers ( vLayers) 1
Bandwidth (BW ) 40 MHz
Subcarrier Spacing ( ∆f) 30 kHz
Physical Resource Blocks ( NPRB) 106 PRBs
Numerology (µ) 1
Scaling Factor ( f) 1
Symbol Duration ( Tµ
s ) 35.7143 µs
Downlink Overhead ( OH) 0.14
Sampling Rate ( fs) 1 second
The Amarisoft testbed allocates 106 PRBs, derived from
the configured bandwidth and subcarrier spacing [17]. The
Rate Controller processes the extracted MCS index, which
determines the modulation order ( Qm), coding efficiency ( f),
and maximum code rate ( Rmax) as specified in [18]. In this
case, the maximum data rate is calculated for downlink (DL),
using equation 1.
The Rate Controller has been implemented using a Python
script that communicates via WebSocket with the Amarisoft
gNB to retrieve network quality metrics. After performing the
estimation, it interacts with the XR Remote Renderer through
an API, instructing it to adjust the streaming quality profile if
necessary. The XR Remote Renderer has been implemented
using the Unity framework [19] and is responsible for
generating the 3D scene and rendering it for transmission
to the XR Client using the WebRTC protocol. The XR
Client is a web-based player implemented in JavaScript,
capable of running on any device with a browser and WebXR
support. Regarding deployment, both the Rate Controller
and XR Remote Renderer are hosted on an Edge Server
with a GPU, while the XR Client is deployed on a laptop
equipped with a 5G modem. This testbed setup provides a
controlled environment to evaluate the relationship between
the calculated data rate, the network configuration, and the
Fig. 3: Comparison between estimated data rate and measured
throughput over time.
adaptability of streaming quality for a remote rendering XR
service.
B. Results and discussion
To validate Equation 1, an experiment was conducted where
the estimated data rate and actual throughput were measured
simultaneously. The actual throughput was obtained using the
iperf3 tool [20], a widely used software for measuring network
performance. The estimated data rate was calculated in real
time using the parameters outlined in Section V-A, leveraging
the data extracted from the Amarisoft logs.
Figure 3 shows the results of this validation experiment.
The graph compares the estimated maximum data rate, as
calculated using the theoretical equation, with the actual data
rate measured via iperf3 over a 60-second period. Both values
were sampled at one-second intervals to ensure consistency in
the comparison.
As shown in the figure, the estimated data rate closely
follows the trend of the measured data rate, demonstrating
the accuracy of the proposed equation under varying network
conditions. While minor discrepancies can be observed, these
are primarily attributed to dynamic network overheads, such as
retransmissions and control signaling, which are not explicitly
accounted for in the theoretical model.
This validation confirms that the proposed equation provides
a reliable estimation of the available network capacity. Based
on this, several experiments were conducted to observe the
impact of the proposed auto-adaptive method on the XR
service described earlier. To this end, QoS of a client
consuming content generated by the XR remote renderer
without any auto-adaptive quality method was compared to
that obtained using the proposed auto-adaptive method.
To ensure a meaningful comparison of the impact of auto-
adaptation, the evaluation was performed in a scenario where
network capacity varied dynamically. Specifically, the test
was designed so that the user equipment (UE), which runs
the XR Client, moved along a predefined trajectory, starting
next to the transmission antenna, where network conditions
were optimal, and gradually moving away until reaching
a maximum distance of 15 meters. The UE then returned

to its original position, completing the trajectory in 140
seconds. This mobility pattern introduced controlled variations
in network capacity, allowing the auto-adaptive method to be
evaluated under fluctuating conditions.
Initially, the remote renderer was launched without any
auto-adaptation mechanism, and various QoS-related metrics
were collected. In this scenario, the transmitted multimedia
content was configured to the Q3 quality profile, as described
in Table I. The same test was then repeated with the
auto-adaptive method enabled, ensuring statistical robustness
through multiple iterations.
Figure 4 presents the estimated data rate during one of the
tests conducted with auto-adaptation enabled. It also illustrates
the streaming quality profile selected at each moment. In the
graph, two horizontal lines can be seen, representing the data
rate thresholds defined for selecting one streaming quality
profile over another (8 Mbps and 36 Mbps). The changes in
the streaming quality profile correspond to the variability of
the estimated bitrate, which ranges from 158.796 Mbps (MCS
= 27) to 5.025 Mbps (MCS = 0).
The observed metrics included the number of switches
(SNb), the number of freezes ( FNb), the total freeze duration
(Ftot(ms)), the average freeze duration ( Favg(ms)) and the
average framerate ( fpsavg), and are presented in Table III.
In the case without adaptation, no changes in the streaming
quality profile were observed, and four freezes occurred,
resulting in a total freeze duration of 4760 ms. The average
duration of each freeze was 1189 ms, while the overall average
framerate throughout the test was 56.12 fps.
When applying the auto-adaptive method, three streaming
quality profile switches were recorded during the test. In this
case, six freezes were observed, with a total freeze duration
Fig. 5: Number of freezes and current streaming profile.
of 3930 ms and an average freeze duration of 786 ms. The
average framerate remained relatively stable at 56.51 fps. The
variation in framerate is due to the freezes, which cause the
framerate to drop.
Comparing the results of both tests, we observe that the
auto-adaptive method led to a higher number of freezes.
However, the total freeze duration and the average freeze
duration were lower than in the non-adaptive case. Regarding
the framerate, no significant differences were observed. To
gain a deeper understanding of the obtained results, additional
tests were conducted using the auto-adaptive system. These
tests revealed that every time the remote renderer performs
a streaming quality profile switch, the WebRTC video
streaming detects a freeze. The experiment was repeated ten
times, confirming that each streaming quality profile switch
consistently causes a freeze with an average duration of 277
ms. This behavior is attributed to a limitation in the remote
renderer’s implementation. Without this limitation, the number
of freezes would be expected to be 3, and the total duration
of freezes approximately 3099 ms.
Figure 5 shows the freezes and changes in the streaming
quality profile over time. The graph illustrates that between
seconds 70 and 80, QoS begins to degrade as freezes start to
happen, until around second 100, which corresponds to the
moment when the XR Client is farthest from the base station,
causing the channel quality to worsen. During this period, the
remote renderer adjusts the video streaming quality profile,
lowering it from Q3 to Q2 and later to Q1. Subsequently,
the remote renderer detects optimal network capacity again
and returns to the Q3 quality profile, restoring streaming
smoothness.
Taking into account the limitations of the XR service used in
the experiments, it is observed that, during 76.43% of the time,
the UE receives the content in the highest available quality. For
the remaining time, the content is delivered at lower quality
levels. This adaptation helps achieve a reduction of 17.4%
in the total freeze time. Furthermore, if the aforementioned
limitations, particularly those related to freezes caused by
changes in the quality of the stream, were not present, the
total freeze time could be reduced by as much as 34.9%.
This demonstrates the potential for further optimization in the

system, should these constraints be alleviated.
VI. C ONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this study, a theoretical model for estimating the
maximum data rate of a 5G network has been utilized, and
its potential application for enhancing the performance of
a remote XR rendering service has been investigated. The
findings demonstrate the positive impact of network bandwidth
monitoring and estimation, combined with an auto-adaptive
method to dynamically adjust the service’s QoS according
to the transmission channel capacity. The impact has been
assessed by analyzing various metrics, including framerate,
the number of freezes, and freeze duration. Furthermore, the
results indicate that the observed performance is constrained
by the implementation of the XR service employed in this
study.
By bridging the gap between physical-layer network insights
and XR application performance, this work lays the foundation
for more resilient and adaptive XR systems. Future work will
investigate how to leverage physical layer metrics to predict
variations in network capacity, enabling auto-adaptation. This
approach aims to further enhance system performance and
quality of service.
