## Research Patterns
- **Prototype-to-production gap**: MAS prototypes can be delivered in 2 weeks but production maturity requires 3-6x longer stabilization phase
- **Human oversight persistence**: MAS should augment not replace humans in high-stakes/regulated domains
- **Cost efficiency via specialization**: Proper LLM-based agent architecture can achieve 6x cost reduction over regex baselines

## Cross-Reference Insights
- arxiv_2601.03624 and arxiv_2601.03328 both emphasize governance/accountability patterns
- SIE (Single Information Environment) pattern from arxiv_2601.03328 maps to "Agentic Communities" tier in arxiv_2601.03624
- Both papers highlight hallucination risks and need for guardrails in production

## 2026-01-14 - Paper: Architecting Agentic Communities using Design Patterns
ID: arxiv_2601.03624
Status: PRESENTED
Score: 23/30

**Summary:** Comprehensive design pattern catalogue (46 patterns) for agentic AI systems organized in three tiers: LLM Agents (task-specific automation), Agentic AI (autonomous reasoning), and Agentic Communities (multi-participant coordination). Uniquely grounds patterns in ISO ODP-EL formal semantics enabling verifiable governance and accountability.

**Key Method:** Three-tier classification derived from ISO/IEC 15414 Open Distributed Processing Enterprise Language. Uses deontic tokens (burden/permit/embargo) for formal accountability chains. Three-step design methodology: (1) Assess use case characteristics, (2) Apply pattern composition (vertical/horizontal/cross-cutting), (3) Scope implementation tier.

**Implementation Check:**
- GitHub repos: Yes
  - https://github.com/sarwarbeing-ai/Agentic_Design_Patterns (Antonio Gulli's book implementation)
  - https://github.com/promptadvisers/agentic-design-patterns-docs (21 patterns documented)
  - https://github.com/nibzard/awesome-agentic-patterns (curated pattern catalogue)
  - https://github.com/ksm26/AI-Agentic-Design-Patterns-with-AutoGen (AutoGen implementation)
- Commercial use: No direct commercialization found
- Open questions: How do ODP-EL formal semantics integrate with existing frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI)? Runtime verification tooling not yet available.

**Score Breakdown:**
- Novelty: 4/5 (Three-tier framework + ODP-EL formal grounding is unique)
- Feasibility: 4/5 (46 patterns with concrete guidance; incremental adoption path)
- Time-to-POC: 3/5 (Patterns usable immediately; ODP-EL has learning curve)
- Value/Market: 5/5 (Enterprise need for systematic agent architecture; compliance-ready)
- Defensibility: 3/5 (Patterns are reusable knowledge; formal grounding is differentiated)
- Adoption: 4/5 (Framework-agnostic; works with existing agent frameworks)

**Decision Rationale:** Highest-value paper for research focus. Three-tier framework directly applicable to building production agents. ODP-EL formal grounding distinguishes from narrative pattern catalogues.

**Extracted Insights:**
- Three-tier classification (LLM Agents→Agentic AI→Agentic Communities) provides clear scoping for incremental development
- Deontic tokens (burden/permit/embargo) enable formal accountability - critical for regulated industries
- Pattern composition: Vertical (foundational→sophisticated), Horizontal (peer patterns), Cross-Cutting (governance overlay)
- Intent vs Obligation distinction preserves autonomy while enabling responsibility chains

**Cross-References:**
- Patterns referenced: ReAct (#1), Reflexion (#6), Constitutional AI (#7), Plan-then-Execute (#41), Memory-Augmented (#3)
- Related papers in pool: arxiv_2509.08646 (Plan-then-Execute focus), arxiv_2512.20845 (Multi-Agent Reflexion), arxiv_2505.07087 (Cognitive patterns)

**Learnings for Future Iterations:**
- Papers grounding agent patterns in formal methods (ISO standards, deontic logic) score higher on enterprise applicability
- GitHub implementation search yields related resources even when paper itself has no direct implementation
- Clinical trial case study pattern: domain-specific case studies validate enterprise applicability

## 2026-01-14 - Paper: LLM-Enabled Multi-Agent Systems: Empirical Evaluation
ID: arxiv_2601.03328
Status: PRESENTED
Score: 23/30

**Summary:** Empirical evaluation of LLM-enabled multi-agent systems across three real-world domains: telecom security, heritage asset management, and utilities customer service. Formalizes design patterns including ReAct agents, Single Information Environment (SIE), hierarchical architectures, supervisor patterns, and swarm configurations.

**Key Method:** Three controlled containerized pilots with stakeholder feedback, sentiment analysis, and UAT with Likert scales measuring correctness, usefulness, clarity, groundedness, and safety. Measures development velocity, cost efficiency, and throughput quantitatively.

**Implementation Check:**
- GitHub repos: General multi-agent patterns (https://github.com/NisaarAgharia/AI-Agents - 83 stars)
- Google ADK patterns: https://developers.googleblog.com/developers-guide-to-multi-agent-patterns-in-adk/
- Commercial use: Yes - Authors from Kaze Technologies/Kaze Consulting (Bath, UK)
- Open questions: How to bridge prototype-to-production gap? What guardrails work for regulated domains?

**Case Study Results:**
| Case | Domain | Architecture | Key Metric |
|------|--------|--------------|------------|
| CS1 | Telecom Security | SIE | CISO approved further investigation |
| CS2 | National Heritage | SIE | 61% positive sentiment |
| CS3 | Utilities Customer Service | Hierarchical | 100% email categorization, £0.05/email vs £0.33 baseline |

**Score Breakdown:**
- Novelty: 3/5 (Formalizes existing patterns; value is in empirical validation)
- Feasibility: 5/5 (Prototypes in 2 weeks, pilots in 1 month - real case studies)
- Time-to-POC: 5/5 (Demonstrated rapid prototyping; clear architectural guidance)
- Value/Market: 4/5 (Enterprise applicability validated; addresses real business needs)
- Defensibility: 2/5 (Patterns are public knowledge; no proprietary advantage)
- Adoption: 4/5 (Works with LangGraph, existing frameworks)

**Decision Rationale:** Highly practical paper with real empirical data from 3 enterprise domains. Key insight: prototype speed doesn't equal production speed - critical for planning.

**Extracted Insights:**
- Prototype-to-production gap: 2 weeks to prototype, but production maturity requires extensive tuning (plan 3-6x longer)
- Single Information Environment (SIE) pattern: Data-centric design with specialist agents per dataset
- Human oversight remains persistent requirement even in automated domains
- Cost efficiency: 6x cost reduction achievable with proper MAS architecture

**Cross-References:**
- SIE architecture relates to "Agentic Communities" tier from arxiv_2601.03624
- Hierarchical patterns share taxonomy with three-tier framework
- Hallucination/grounding risks echo formal governance needs from arxiv_2601.03624

**Learnings for Future Iterations:**
- Papers with quantitative metrics (£/email, throughput, accuracy) are more actionable than pure theoretical frameworks
- Authors' commercial affiliation indicates real-world applicability
- Google ADK documentation provides complementary pattern catalogue (8 patterns: Sequential Pipeline, Coordinator, Parallel Fan-Out, Hierarchical, Generator-Critic, Iterative Refinement, Human-in-Loop, Composite)
