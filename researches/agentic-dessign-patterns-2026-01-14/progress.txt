## Research Patterns
- **Prototype-to-production gap**: MAS prototypes can be delivered in 2 weeks but production maturity requires 3-6x longer stabilization phase
- **Human oversight persistence**: MAS should augment not replace humans in high-stakes/regulated domains
- **Cost efficiency via specialization**: Proper LLM-based agent architecture can achieve 6x cost reduction over regex baselines
- **Framework selection heuristic**: Graph-based (LangGraph) for branching workflows; Role-based (CrewAI) for team collaboration; Conversational (AutoGen) for prototyping
- **Control-flow integrity for security**: Generate plans in trusted state BEFORE ingesting untrusted data - P-t-E pattern provides inherent prompt injection resistance
- **Dual LLM pattern**: Separate privileged (planning) from quarantined (untrusted input) LLMs for architectural isolation

## Cross-Reference Insights
- arxiv_2601.03624 and arxiv_2601.03328 both emphasize governance/accountability patterns
- SIE (Single Information Environment) pattern from arxiv_2601.03328 maps to "Agentic Communities" tier in arxiv_2601.03624
- Both papers highlight hallucination risks and need for guardrails in production
- arxiv_2508.10146 framework taxonomy complements three-tier model from arxiv_2601.03624
- A2A vs ANP protocols are complementary: A2A for enterprise task orchestration, ANP for decentralized discovery

## 2026-01-14 - Paper: Architecting Agentic Communities using Design Patterns
ID: arxiv_2601.03624
Status: PRESENTED
Score: 23/30

**Summary:** Comprehensive design pattern catalogue (46 patterns) for agentic AI systems organized in three tiers: LLM Agents (task-specific automation), Agentic AI (autonomous reasoning), and Agentic Communities (multi-participant coordination). Uniquely grounds patterns in ISO ODP-EL formal semantics enabling verifiable governance and accountability.

**Key Method:** Three-tier classification derived from ISO/IEC 15414 Open Distributed Processing Enterprise Language. Uses deontic tokens (burden/permit/embargo) for formal accountability chains. Three-step design methodology: (1) Assess use case characteristics, (2) Apply pattern composition (vertical/horizontal/cross-cutting), (3) Scope implementation tier.

**Implementation Check:**
- GitHub repos: Yes
  - https://github.com/sarwarbeing-ai/Agentic_Design_Patterns (Antonio Gulli's book implementation)
  - https://github.com/promptadvisers/agentic-design-patterns-docs (21 patterns documented)
  - https://github.com/nibzard/awesome-agentic-patterns (curated pattern catalogue)
  - https://github.com/ksm26/AI-Agentic-Design-Patterns-with-AutoGen (AutoGen implementation)
- Commercial use: No direct commercialization found
- Open questions: How do ODP-EL formal semantics integrate with existing frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI)? Runtime verification tooling not yet available.

**Score Breakdown:**
- Novelty: 4/5 (Three-tier framework + ODP-EL formal grounding is unique)
- Feasibility: 4/5 (46 patterns with concrete guidance; incremental adoption path)
- Time-to-POC: 3/5 (Patterns usable immediately; ODP-EL has learning curve)
- Value/Market: 5/5 (Enterprise need for systematic agent architecture; compliance-ready)
- Defensibility: 3/5 (Patterns are reusable knowledge; formal grounding is differentiated)
- Adoption: 4/5 (Framework-agnostic; works with existing agent frameworks)

**Decision Rationale:** Highest-value paper for research focus. Three-tier framework directly applicable to building production agents. ODP-EL formal grounding distinguishes from narrative pattern catalogues.

**Extracted Insights:**
- Three-tier classification (LLM Agents→Agentic AI→Agentic Communities) provides clear scoping for incremental development
- Deontic tokens (burden/permit/embargo) enable formal accountability - critical for regulated industries
- Pattern composition: Vertical (foundational→sophisticated), Horizontal (peer patterns), Cross-Cutting (governance overlay)
- Intent vs Obligation distinction preserves autonomy while enabling responsibility chains

**Cross-References:**
- Patterns referenced: ReAct (#1), Reflexion (#6), Constitutional AI (#7), Plan-then-Execute (#41), Memory-Augmented (#3)
- Related papers in pool: arxiv_2509.08646 (Plan-then-Execute focus), arxiv_2512.20845 (Multi-Agent Reflexion), arxiv_2505.07087 (Cognitive patterns)

**Learnings for Future Iterations:**
- Papers grounding agent patterns in formal methods (ISO standards, deontic logic) score higher on enterprise applicability
- GitHub implementation search yields related resources even when paper itself has no direct implementation
- Clinical trial case study pattern: domain-specific case studies validate enterprise applicability

- Google ADK patterns: https://developers.googleblog.com/developers-guide-to-multi-agent-patterns-in-adk/
- Commercial use: Yes - Authors from Kaze Technologies/Kaze Consulting (Bath, UK)
- Open questions: How to bridge prototype-to-production gap? What guardrails work for regulated domains?

**Case Study Results:**
| Case | Domain | Architecture | Key Metric |
|------|--------|--------------|------------|
| CS1 | Telecom Security | SIE | CISO approved further investigation |
| CS2 | National Heritage | SIE | 61% positive sentiment |

- Value/Market: 4/5 (Enterprise applicability validated; addresses real business needs)
- Defensibility: 2/5 (Patterns are public knowledge; no proprietary advantage)
- Adoption: 4/5 (Works with LangGraph, existing frameworks)

**Decision Rationale:** Highly practical paper with real empirical data from 3 enterprise domains. Key insight: prototype speed doesn't equal production speed - critical for planning.

**Extracted Insights:**
- Prototype-to-production gap: 2 weeks to prototype, but production maturity requires extensive tuning (plan 3-6x longer)
- Single Information Environment (SIE) pattern: Data-centric design with specialist agents per dataset
- Human oversight remains persistent requirement even in automated domains
- Cost efficiency: 6x cost reduction achievable with proper MAS architecture

**Cross-References:**
- SIE architecture relates to "Agentic Communities" tier from arxiv_2601.03624
- Hierarchical patterns share taxonomy with three-tier framework
- Hallucination/grounding risks echo formal governance needs from arxiv_2601.03624

**Learnings for Future Iterations:**
- Papers with quantitative metrics (£/email, throughput, accuracy) are more actionable than pure theoretical frameworks
- Authors' commercial affiliation indicates real-world applicability
- Google ADK documentation provides complementary pattern catalogue (8 patterns: Sequential Pipeline, Coordinator, Parallel Fan-Out, Hierarchical, Generator-Critic, Iterative Refinement, Human-in-Loop, Composite)

## 2026-01-14 - Paper: Agentic AI Frameworks: Architectures, Protocols, and Design Challenges
ID: arxiv_2508.10146
Status: PRESENTED
Score: 23/30

**Summary:** Systematic review and comparative analysis of 7 major agentic AI frameworks (CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen, Semantic Kernel, Agno, Google ADK, MetaGPT) and 4 agent communication protocols (MCP, ACP, A2A, ANP). Establishes foundational taxonomy for agentic AI systems covering orchestration approaches, memory implementations, guardrails, and service computing readiness.

**Key Method:** Multi-dimensional framework comparison across: architectural approaches (graph-based vs role-based vs conversational), memory implementations (stateful nodes vs agent-level vs shared dialogue), guardrails (validators, retry logic, trust layers), and SOA alignment. Protocol analysis covers message formats, discovery mechanisms, and transport layers.

**Implementation Check:**

  - https://github.com/agent-network-protocol/AgentNetworkProtocol (ANP Protocol)
  - https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph (LangGraph)
  - https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI (CrewAI)
  - https://github.com/microsoft/autogen (AutoGen)
- Commercial use: Yes - all frameworks are backed by commercial entities
  - LangChain/LangGraph: LangChain Inc
  - CrewAI: CrewAI Inc
  - AutoGen & Semantic Kernel: Microsoft
  - Google ADK: Google

## 2026-01-14 - Paper: Fundamentals of Building Autonomous LLM Agents
ID: arxiv_2510.09244
Status: PRESENTED
Score: 19/30

**Summary:** TUM seminar technical report defining a four-component architecture for autonomous LLM agents: Perception (environmental sensing), Reasoning (planning and adaptation), Memory (short/long-term storage), and Execution (action translation). Synthesizes existing patterns (ReAct, CoT, ToT, RAG, MCTS) into a coherent educational framework with practical design recommendations.

**Key Method:** Structured review organizing agent capabilities into four cognitive-inspired systems. The paper identifies:
- Four perception approaches: text-based, multimodal, structured data (DOM/accessibility trees), tool-augmented
- Four reasoning patterns: task decomposition (HuggingGPT, ReAct), multi-plan generation (ToT, MCTS), reflection, multi-agent experts
- Three memory types: long-term (RAG, SQL, fine-tuning), short-term (context window), storage (experiences, procedures, domain, user)
- Four execution modes: tool integration, visual/GUI automation, code generation, robotic control

**Implementation Check:**
- GitHub repos: Multiple educational resources found
  - https://github.com/artnitolog/awesome-agent-learning (courses + assignments)
  - https://github.com/HKUDS/AutoAgent (zero-code agent framework)
  - https://github.com/victordibia/designing-multiagent-systems (multi-agent from scratch)
  - https://github.com/tmgthb/Autonomous-Agents (research papers repository)
- Commercial use: No direct commercialization; TUM academic context
- Open questions: How to close 72% vs 43% human-AI performance gap? Solutions for repetitive action loops?

**Score Breakdown:**
- Novelty: 2/5 (Educational synthesis; consolidates known patterns without advancing state-of-art)
- Feasibility: 5/5 (Four-component model directly implementable; clear mental model)
- Time-to-POC: 4/5 (Clear principles; multiple linked implementations accelerate prototyping)
- Value/Market: 3/5 (High educational value; no competitive edge as public knowledge synthesis)
- Defensibility: 1/5 (Seminar report; no proprietary techniques or novel methods)
- Adoption: 4/5 (Framework-agnostic; principles applicable to any agent implementation)

**Decision Rationale:** Meets threshold as foundational educational reference. Four-component framework provides clear mental model for agent design. Benchmark gap analysis (72% human vs 43% AI) quantifies current limitations.

**Extracted Insights:**
- Four-component architecture (Perception→Reasoning→Memory→Execution) provides foundational mental model
- Human-AI performance gap: 72%+ for humans vs ~43% for leading AI on OSWorld - sets realistic expectations
- Agent vs workflow distinction: "Simply augmenting an LLM with modules, tools, or predefined steps does not make it an agent" - agents act according to feedback

**Critical Challenges Identified:**
1. GUI grounding - mapping screenshots to precise interaction coordinates unreliable
2. Repetitive actions - agents frequently enter unproductive loops
3. UI robustness - unexpected elements/layout changes cause failures
4. Context window - constraints require aggressive summarization

**Cross-References:**
- Four-component model relates to three-tier framework from arxiv_2601.03624
- Memory patterns connect to arxiv_2508.10146 framework comparison
- Reasoning patterns (CoT, ToT, MCTS) connect to arxiv_2502.05078 and arxiv_2401.14295

**Learnings for Future Iterations:**
- Educational synthesis papers score lower on novelty/defensibility but high on feasibility/adoption
- Quantified benchmark gaps (72% vs 43%) are valuable for setting expectations
- Agent vs workflow distinction is foundational for avoiding over-engineered solutions

## 2026-01-14 - Paper: Architecting Resilient LLM Agents: Secure Plan-then-Execute
ID: arxiv_2509.08646
Status: PRESENTED
Score: 25/30

**Summary:** Security-first guide to Plan-then-Execute (P-t-E) architecture for LLM agents. Separates strategic planning (powerful LLM generates structured plan) from tactical execution (simpler Executor carries out steps). Core innovation is framing P-t-E as inherent defense against indirect prompt injection through control-flow integrity - plans generated in trusted state before ingesting untrusted external data.

**Key Method:** Defense-in-depth strategy with multiple layers:
1. Control-flow integrity - locked execution sequences resist manipulation
2. Principle of least privilege - executors receive only task-scoped tools
3. Dual LLM pattern - separate privileged (planning) and quarantined (untrusted input) LLMs
4. Input sanitization and output filtering (PII, policy violations)
5. Docker containerization mandatory for code execution
6. Human-in-the-loop verification for critical actions

**Implementation Check:**
- GitHub repos: Yes
  - https://github.com/RichardHGL/CHI2025_Plan-then-Execute_LLMAgent (CHI 2025 user study, 248 participants)
  - https://github.com/dasiths/llm-plan-and-execute-knowledge-provider-mesh (Dapr-based distributed implementation)
  - https://github.com/gitcommitshow/resilient-llm (resilient multi-LLM orchestration library)
- Commercial use: Yes - SAP under review as recommended architecture pattern for multi-agent solutions
- Framework blueprints: LangGraph (state machines), CrewAI (hierarchical/declarative), AutoGen (GroupChat + Docker)
- Open questions: How to minimize upfront latency? Optimal re-planning trigger conditions?

**Score Breakdown:**
- Novelty: 4/5 (Security-first framing of P-t-E is novel; control-flow integrity concept unique)
- Feasibility: 5/5 (Framework implementations provided; practical guidance immediately usable)
- Time-to-POC: 4/5 (Code blueprints for 3 frameworks; SAP adoption accelerates enterprise path)
- Value/Market: 5/5 (SAP adoption validates enterprise demand; security focus critical post-CVE-2025-53773)
- Defensibility: 3/5 (Pattern is public knowledge; security integration approach differentiates)
- Adoption: 4/5 (Works with LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen; SAP enterprise validation)

**Decision Rationale:** Highest-scoring paper so far (25/30). Security-first framing addresses critical production gap identified in earlier papers. SAP enterprise adoption validates market readiness. CHI 2025 user study provides human factors data on trust calibration.

**Extracted Insights:**
- Control-flow integrity: Plans generated in trusted state BEFORE ingesting untrusted data - prevents prompt injection by design
- Principle of least privilege: Task-scoped tool access prevents unauthorized function calls even under attack
- Dual LLM pattern: Architectural isolation between privileged/quarantined LLMs prevents privilege escalation
- Trade-offs: Better reasoning/security vs upfront latency and wasted effort on early failures

**Cross-References:**
- Complements arxiv_2506.08837 (security design patterns) - both address prompt injection
- Extends Plan-then-Execute (#41) from arxiv_2601.03624 three-tier pattern catalogue
- Framework implementations relate to arxiv_2508.10146 framework comparison
- Human trust calibration finding connects to human oversight requirements from arxiv_2601.03328

**Security Landscape Context:**
- OWASP 2025: Prompt injection is fundamental architectural vulnerability requiring defense-in-depth
- Recent research (NAACL 2025): Adaptive attacks bypass 12 published defenses with >90% success rate
- Microsoft FIDES: Information-flow control techniques for deterministic prompt injection prevention
- GitHub Copilot CVE-2025-53773: Remote code execution (CVSS 9.6) demonstrates real-world risk

**Learnings for Future Iterations:**
- Papers with enterprise adoption (SAP) validation score higher on market value
- Security-focused papers increasingly relevant as agent systems move to production
- CHI user studies provide valuable human factors data beyond technical benchmarks
- Cross-referencing security literature (OWASP, CVEs) provides real-world context
