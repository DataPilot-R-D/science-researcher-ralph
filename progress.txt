## Research Patterns
- (Patterns discovered during research will be added here)

## Cross-Reference Insights
- **LLM spatial reasoning benchmarks:** arxiv_2601.05529 (ASCII maps) and arxiv_2601.03590 (coordinate-aware text) both isolate spatial reasoning from visual perception; both find significant model variance and failure modes in global/safety-critical scenarios.
- **VLA landscape (2025-2026):** Three major approaches emerging: (1) MoT with visual foresight (InternVLA-A1/AgiBot), (2) Diffusion LLM backbone (Dream-VLA/HKU), (3) Flow matching with diverse co-training (π0.5/Physical Intelligence). All emphasize data diversity; Physical Intelligence ($5.6B) and AgiBot ($6.4B) lead commercially.

## 2026-01-13 - Paper: Follow the Signs: Using Textual Cues and LLMs to Guide Efficient Robot Navigation
ID: arxiv_2601.06652
Status: PRESENTED
Score: 19/30

**Summary:** Proposes an LLM-guided semantic navigation framework that infers numbering/signage patterns to predict likely goal regions, then combines confidence-guided exploration with frontier exploration and A* for efficient goal finding in partially observed indoor maps. Experiments across synthetic, real floor-plan, and noisy environments show higher SPL and success rates than NavGPT, LLM-only, and frontier-only baselines, with a real-world Spot robot demo.

**Key Method:** Maintain seen occupancy/semantic grids, prompt an LLM for directional goal-region predictions from textual cues, update a decayed confidence grid, and plan with A* to the highest-confidence region (fallback to nearest frontier when confidence is uniform).

**Implementation Check:**
- GitHub repos: no (GitHub search for title and arXiv ID returned none)
- Commercial use: no public evidence found
- Open questions: Any public code or supplementary material links beyond the paper; how robust is perception when signs are detected on-device instead of pre-annotated grids?

**Score Breakdown:**
- Novelty: 3/5
- Feasibility: 4/5
- Time-to-POC: 4/5
- Value/Market: 3/5
- Defensibility: 2/5
- Adoption: 3/5

**Decision Rationale:** Combines LLM semantic reasoning with a confidence-grid + frontier exploration loop to improve navigation efficiency; practical but relies on pre-annotated semantics and struggles with ambiguous numbering.

**Extracted Insights:**
- Decayed confidence grids can stabilize noisy LLM directional predictions while preserving completeness via frontier exploration.
- Textual signage/numbering is a strong cue for structured environments and can outperform object-centric heuristics for goal localization.

**Learnings for Future Iterations:**
- DuckDuckGo HTML search triggered an anti-bot challenge; prefer GitHub API and other sources for implementation checks when web search is blocked.

**Doc Update:** Added a Common Gotchas note about DuckDuckGo HTML bot challenges in `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.

## 2026-01-13 - Paper: Model Reconciliation through Explainability and Collaborative Recovery in Assistive Robotics
ID: arxiv_2601.06552
Status: PRESENTED
Score: 18/30

**Summary:** Presents an LLM-driven model reconciliation framework for shared-control assistive robots that predicts and explains differences between human and robot mental models without requiring an explicit user model. After explanation, a recovery workflow lets the human correct the robot via rebuttals, supported by a VLM that matches objects in camera views or updates symbolic world states. Validation includes a real wheelchair-based mobile manipulator and a digital-twin evaluation dataset.

**Key Method:** Use an LLM to extract objects/actions from user queries and match them against a robot's object database, world model, and action graph to classify divergence types (D_GO, D_SO, D_GA, D_SA, FD), then trigger recovery via VLM-based object matching, movement suggestions, or symbolic state overrides.

**Implementation Check:**
- GitHub repos: no (GitHub API search for title and arXiv ID returned none)
- Commercial use: no public evidence found
- Open questions: Will code or datasets be released; how well does the recovery pipeline generalize beyond the small set of daily-living scenarios?

**Score Breakdown:**
- Novelty: 3/5
- Feasibility: 3/5
- Time-to-POC: 4/5
- Value/Market: 3/5
- Defensibility: 2/5
- Adoption: 3/5

**Decision Rationale:** The framework is practical for explainability and recovery in assistive robotics with real-robot validation, but it relies on clean semantic labels and has limited scenario coverage, keeping the score at the threshold.

**Extracted Insights:**
- LLM-based reconciliation grounded in robot models outperforms vision-only baselines for failure explanations in the reported unit tests.
- Adding a translation dictionary for uncommon robot labels boosted precondition explanation accuracy from 78.8% to 92.4%.

**Cross-References:**
- Related to: none yet

**Learnings for Future Iterations:**
- When evaluating LLM explainability for robots, check whether labels are semantically interpretable and whether a translation dictionary was needed.

**Doc Update:** Added a Common Gotchas note about semantic label mismatches in `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.

## 2026-01-13 - Paper: Safety Not Found (404): Hidden Risks of LLM-Based Robotics Decision Making
ID: arxiv_2601.05529
Status: PRESENTED
Score: 19/30

**Summary:** First systematic safety benchmark for LLM-controlled robots, introducing seven tasks across three categories: Complete Information (ASCII map navigation), Incomplete Information (hallucination tests via sequence reasoning), and Safety-Oriented Spatial Reasoning (SOSR) for emergency decision-making. The fire evacuation scenario reveals catastrophic failures where models direct users toward hazards instead of exits.

**Key Method:** Complete Information tasks use ASCII maps to isolate spatial reasoning from visual processing; Incomplete Information tasks test for hallucinations via trajectory validation and uncertain terrain navigation; SOSR tasks evaluate direction sense and emergency decisions in life-threatening contexts. Evaluated GPT-5, GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5 Flash, Gemini-2.0 Flash, and LLaMA-3-8b.

**Implementation Check:**
- GitHub repos: no (GitHub API search returned no results)
- Commercial use: no public evidence found; this is primarily diagnostic research
- Open questions: Will code/benchmark be released? How to extend beyond the 100-video preliminary dataset?

**Score Breakdown:**
- Novelty: 3/5
- Feasibility: 4/5
- Time-to-POC: 4/5
- Value/Market: 3/5
- Defensibility: 2/5
- Adoption: 3/5

**Decision Rationale:** Provides actionable diagnostic insights for anyone building LLM-based robotics. The finding that Gemini-2.5 Flash directs users to wrong locations 33% of the time in fire emergencies is immediately useful for risk assessment. Lacks concrete mitigation strategies but the benchmark methodology is straightforward to implement.

**Extracted Insights:**
- Even 99% accuracy is dangerous in robotics: 1/100 catastrophic failures is unacceptable for safety-critical systems.
- ASCII map navigation isolates spatial reasoning and reveals stark model differences (GPT-5: 100% vs LLaMA-3-8b: 0% on hard tasks).
- In fire evacuation scenarios, Gemini-2.5 Flash directed users to professor's office (32%) or hallucinated server room (1%) instead of exits.

**Cross-References:**
- Related to: arxiv_2601.06652 (both address LLM spatial reasoning for navigation, but this focuses on failure modes rather than methods)

**Learnings for Future Iterations:**
- When evaluating LLM-robotics papers, look for worst-case failure analysis, not just aggregate accuracy.
- Safety benchmarks for robotics should include emergency scenarios where errors have physical consequences.

## 2026-01-13 - Paper: Can LLMs See Without Pixels? Benchmarking Spatial Intelligence from Textual Descriptions
ID: arxiv_2601.03590
Status: INSIGHTS_EXTRACTED
Score: 17/30

**Summary:** Introduces SiT-Bench, the first large-scale benchmark to evaluate spatial intelligence of LLMs using text-only descriptions (no pixels). Tests whether spatial reasoning originates from visual encoders or language model backbones by converting scenes into coordinate-aware textual descriptions across 3,892 samples in 5 categories and 17 subtasks.

**Key Method:** Data constructed via GPT-4o quality scoring on robotic, gaming, and simulated environments, plus adapted existing vision benchmarks converted to text. Two-phase verification with DeepSeek-R1 filtering and human review. Categories: Navigation & Planning (23.1%), Embodied & Fine-grained (28.4%), Multi-View & Geometric Reasoning (21.5%), Global Perception & Mapping (15.4%), Logic Detection (11.6%).

**Implementation Check:**
- GitHub repos: no (GitHub API search returned no results)
- Commercial use: no; this is research benchmark infrastructure
- Open questions: Will the dataset be released? What's the plan for extending to more subtasks?

**Score Breakdown:**
- Novelty: 3/5
- Feasibility: 4/5
- Time-to-POC: 3/5
- Value/Market: 2/5
- Defensibility: 2/5
- Adoption: 3/5

**Decision Rationale:** Below threshold (17/30) but provides valuable diagnostic methodology. Key finding that VLMs outperform pure LLMs even on text-only spatial tasks suggests multimodal training embeds spatial priors. Latency concerns (35-70× slowdown with thinking modes) make it less directly actionable for real-time robotics.

**Extracted Insights:**
- VLMs outperform pure LLMs on text-only spatial tasks, suggesting multimodal training embeds spatial priors into language weights.
- Explicit reasoning (CoT) boosts spatial performance significantly (Qwen3-8B: 37.91% → 45.04%) but 35-70× latency increase is incompatible with real-time robotics.
- LLMs excel at localized semantic spatial tasks but show a critical "spatial gap" in global consistency (Cognitive Mapping: 8.34% best model vs 26.77% human).

**Cross-References:**
- Related to: arxiv_2601.05529 (both evaluate LLM spatial reasoning with text-based representations; this uses coordinate-aware descriptions, that uses ASCII maps)

**Learnings for Future Iterations:**
- Text-only spatial benchmarks can reveal model capabilities that visual benchmarks conflate with perception.
- When evaluating embodied AI capabilities, distinguish between localized semantic tasks (where LLMs do well) and global consistency tasks (where they fail).

Status: PRESENTED
Score: 23/30

**Summary:** Presents InternVLA-A1, a Mixture-of-Transformers VLA architecture that unifies scene understanding, visual foresight generation, and action execution in a single model. Built on InternVL3/Qwen3-VL backbones, trained on 533M+ frames from InternData-A1 (synthetic) and AgiBot-World (real). Achieves 75.1% success on general manipulation tasks and 40-73% improvement over pi0/GR00T on dynamic manipulation.

**Key Method:** Three coordinated transformer experts with blockwise masked self-attention:
1. Understanding Expert: Semantic comprehension via multimodal LLM (InternVL3 or Qwen3-VL)
2. Generation Expert: Visual foresight prediction using Cosmos VAE (256×256 → 4×4 latent)
3. Action Expert: Flow matching for action prediction, combining semantic context + predicted dynamics

Two-stage training: 700K steps pre-training (AdamW, constant 5×10⁻⁵ LR), 60K steps post-training (warmup/decay). Joint loss: λ·Lgen + Laction (λ=0.01).

**Implementation Check:**
- GitHub repos: yes - https://github.com/InternRobotics/InternVLA-A1 (248 stars, active)
- HuggingFace: model (InternRobotics/InternVLA-A1-3B) and dataset (InternRobotics/InternData-A1) released
- Commercial use: yes - connected to AgiBot (Zhiyuan Robotics), ~$1B valuation, mass-producing humanoid robots
- Open questions: License not specified; how does performance scale with smaller training data budgets?

**Score Breakdown:**
- Novelty: 4/5 - MoT architecture with visual foresight expert is meaningful; builds on established VLA paradigms
- Feasibility: 4/5 - Proven real-world results, full open-source stack; requires 533M+ frames and significant compute
- Time-to-POC: 4/5 - Pre-trained models available, 13Hz inference, needs robot hardware

- Defensibility: 3/5 - Architecture is published openly; main moat is training data scale
- Adoption: 4/5 - Complete open-source ecosystem (code, weights, dataset)

**Decision Rationale:** Strong VLA contribution with practical implementation. Visual foresight prediction yields substantial gains on dynamic tasks. Full open-source release lowers barrier to entry. Commercial validation via AgiBot.

**Extracted Insights:**
- Visual foresight prediction improves dynamic manipulation by 19.4% (ablation); biggest gains on moving objects (+40-73%)
- MoT with blockwise masked attention enables efficient multi-capability integration
- Hybrid synthetic-real training: synthetic dominates simulation, mixed achieves best real-world; pre-training contributes 51.6% gain

**Cross-References:**
- Related to: arxiv_2512.22615 (Dream-VLA also uses diffusion for VLA), arxiv_2512.22414 (human-to-robot transfer in VLAs)

**Learnings for Future Iterations:**
- Visual foresight is particularly valuable for dynamic manipulation tasks; static pick-and-place shows smaller gains
- Full open-source VLA releases (code + weights + data) are becoming industry standard for top research labs

**Decision Rationale:** Strong simulation platform with practical commercial validation. LLM-powered scene generation + VLM evaluation reduces manual effort. R²=0.924 sim-to-real correlation demonstrates synthetic data viability. Same team as InternVLA-A1, indicating coherent robotics stack.

**Extracted Insights:**
- LLM-powered 4-stage scene generation can produce thousands of diverse scenes in minutes from natural language
- Sim-to-real R²=0.924 validates synthetic data at scale, but equivalent-volume real data still outperforms
- VLM-based automated evaluation with LLM-generated protocols enables large-scale benchmark creation

**Cross-References:**
- Related to: arxiv_2601.02456 (InternVLA-A1 - same company, uses Genie Sim for training data)

**Learnings for Future Iterations:**
- AgiBot (AgibotTech) is building a coherent robotics stack: simulator (Genie Sim) + VLA model (InternVLA-A1) + dataset (AgiBot-World) - worth tracking their releases
- Isaac Sim + OpenUSD is becoming the de facto standard for high-fidelity robot simulation

## 2026-01-13 - Paper: Digital Twin AI: Opportunities and Challenges from Large Language Models to World Models
ID: arxiv_2601.01321
Status: REJECTED
Score: 10/30

**Summary:** Comprehensive survey paper (27 authors from 12+ institutions) presenting a four-stage framework for AI integration in digital twins: (1) physics-based modeling, (2) real-time mirroring/synchronization, (3) intervention through prediction/optimization, and (4) autonomous management via LLMs and agents. Covers 11 application domains including healthcare, aerospace, manufacturing, and robotics.

**Key Method:** Conceptual framework synthesizing existing technologies—no novel implementation. Reviews physics-informed AI (PINNs, Neural Operators), generative models for scene representation (NeRF, 3DGS), LLM-based autonomous management, and world models (NVIDIA Cosmos). The four-stage lifecycle (Modeling → Mirroring → Intervening → Autonomous Management) organizes existing work rather than proposing new methods.

**Implementation Check:**
- GitHub repos: no (GitHub API search returned no results)
- Commercial use: no; this is a survey/review paper
- Open questions: N/A—survey paper with no artifacts to release

**Score Breakdown:**
- Novelty: 2/5 - Survey organizing existing work, no new methods or architectures
- Feasibility: 2/5 - No concrete implementation to build on
- Time-to-POC: 1/5 - Conceptual framework with nothing directly actionable
- Value/Market: 2/5 - Good reference for landscape understanding but no direct application
- Defensibility: 1/5 - N/A for survey papers
- Adoption: 2/5 - Useful as reference but no artifacts (code, models, datasets)

**Decision Rationale:** Survey paper providing landscape overview but no actionable methodology or artifacts. The four-stage framework is conceptual rather than implementable. Useful for understanding digital twin + AI integration patterns, but low POC potential. Authors explicitly acknowledge LLM/world models "do not guarantee physical fidelity or closed-loop stability" and their role "remains largely exploratory."

**Extracted Insights:**
- Four-stage framework (Modeling → Mirroring → Intervening → Autonomous) provides useful taxonomy for organizing digital twin AI integration work
- Key limitation: current LLM/world models "do not guarantee physical fidelity or closed-loop stability" for robotics applications
- Missing from field: unified evaluation metrics, head-to-head comparisons, ablation studies, long-term robustness testing

**Cross-References:**
- Related to: arxiv_2601.02078 (Genie Sim - concrete implementation of LLM-powered digital twin generation that this survey would reference)

**Learnings for Future Iterations:**
- Survey papers rarely score above threshold due to lack of novel implementation; prioritize papers with code/weights/benchmarks
- "Exploratory" framing in surveys indicates the field lacks mature solutions—be cautious of overclaiming in related application papers

ID: arxiv_2601.01196
Status: REJECTED
Score: 14/30

**Summary:** Educational platform for zero-code robot control using LLMs with CoppeliaSim. Uses LangChain with Llama3 (70b via Groq, 8b via Ollama) to translate natural language instructions into executable Python control code. Four-module architecture: NL interface, LLM planner, simulation backend (CoppeliaSim remote API), and Gradio frontend.

**Key Method:** Structured prompt templates convert natural language instructions to executable Python via executeActionCode function. Supports direct (step-by-step commands) and autonomous operation modes. RobotController class manages locomotion and manipulation. Multi-robot collaboration via sequential action generation across agents (tested on three YouBot configurations).

**Implementation Check:**
- GitHub repos: no (GitHub API search for title and arXiv ID returned none)
- Commercial use: no; academic research project for educational accessibility
- Open questions: Will code be released? How does it compare to Isaac Sim Academy or Robot Virtual Worlds?

**Score Breakdown:**
- Novelty: 2/5 - Incremental over GenSim and similar LLM-to-simulation work; educational focus is niche
- Feasibility: 3/5 - Uses off-the-shelf tools but no code released
- Time-to-POC: 4/5 - Well-documented architecture, could replicate in days
- Value/Market: 2/5 - Educational niche is small; free alternatives exist
- Defensibility: 1/5 - No unique tech or data; trivially replicable
- Adoption: 2/5 - CoppeliaSim has smaller community than Isaac Sim; no code release

**Decision Rationale:** Straightforward educational tool combining off-the-shelf components (CoppeliaSim, LangChain, Gradio, Llama3). While useful for teaching robotics to beginners, lacks novelty, defensibility, and commercial potential. Score 14/30 well below threshold.

**Extracted Insights:**
- (None significant - standard LLM-to-code pipeline applied to educational context)

**Cross-References:**
- Related to: arxiv_2601.02078 (Genie Sim) - same domain (LLM-powered simulation) but Genie Sim is far more sophisticated and commercially validated

**Learnings for Future Iterations:**
- Educational platforms tend to score low on defensibility and value/market unless they introduce novel pedagogical methods or achieve significant scale
- CoppeliaSim-based work has smaller potential reach than Isaac Sim-based work due to community size

Status: PRESENTED
Score: 23/30

**Summary:** First diffusion-based vision-language and vision-language-action models. Dream-VL and Dream-VLA use a discrete diffusion language model (Dream 7B) as backbone instead of autoregressive LLMs. Built by HKU NLP Group + Huawei Noah's Ark Lab. Key innovation: bidirectional masked diffusion enables parallel action generation with 27× speedup over autoregressive methods.

**Key Method:** Dream 7B discrete diffusion LLM backbone with Qwen2ViT vision encoder. Dream-VL trained on 12M MAmmoTH-VL multimodal data. Dream-VLA pretrained on 970K Open-X Embodiment robot trajectories. Native action chunking support without architectural modifications.

- Single diffusion step achieves competitive performance, enabling efficient real-time inference
- VLM trained on diffusion loss maintains strong benchmark performance (94.4% DocVQA)

**Cross-References:**
- Related to: arxiv_2601.02456 (InternVLA-A1) - both state-of-the-art VLAs with different architectures (MoT vs diffusion); Dream-VLA achieves higher LIBERO score (97.2% vs 75.1%) but InternVLA-A1 tested on real robots
- Related to: arxiv_2512.22414 (Human-to-Robot Transfer) - both explore VLA architectures

**Learnings for Future Iterations:**
- Diffusion LLM is emerging as alternative to autoregressive backbone for VLAs; track HKU NLP's Dream family releases
- Apache 2.0 licensing makes HKU NLP models more commercially accessible than some alternatives
- SimplerEnv is becoming standard VLA benchmark; scores are directly comparable across papers

## 2026-01-14 - Paper: Emergence of Human to Robot Transfer in Vision-Language-Action Models
ID: arxiv_2512.22414
Status: PRESENTED
Score: 24/30

**Summary:** Demonstrates that human-to-robot transfer is an emergent property of diverse VLA pretraining. By co-training π₀.₅ on 14 hours of embodied human video (head/wrist-mounted cameras with SLAM tracking) alongside robot teleoperation data, the approach nearly doubles performance on generalization settings seen only in human data. Key finding: no explicit alignment mechanism needed—embodiment-agnostic representations emerge naturally with sufficient pretraining diversity.

**Key Method:** Equip human demonstrators with head-mounted and wrist-worn cameras. Process via visual SLAM for 6D head motion tracking and 3D hand keypoint extraction. Co-train VLA on both human and robot data with identical objectives: flow matching for low-level action prediction, language annotations for high-level subtask prediction. Transfer emerges once model sees sufficient diversity across scenes, tasks, and embodiments.

**Implementation Check:**
- GitHub repos: yes - https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi (9,800 stars, Apache 2.0)
- Commercial use: yes - Physical Intelligence ($5.6B valuation, $1.07B raised total). Founders include Karol Hausman (CEO), Chelsea Finn, and Lachy Groom. Backed by CapitalG, Jeff Bezos, Thrive, Lux, Amazon, T. Rowe Price.
- Open questions: Can human video scale to internet-video levels without specialized cameras? What's the minimum diversity threshold for emergence?

**Score Breakdown:**
- Novelty: 4/5 - First demonstration of emergent human-to-robot transfer; challenges assumption that explicit domain adaptation is required
- Feasibility: 4/5 - Builds on π₀.₅ which is deployed in real homes; requires diverse pretraining data
- Time-to-POC: 4/5 - openpi provides pretrained checkpoints and fine-tuning recipes
- Value/Market: 5/5 - Physical Intelligence is highest-valued robotics AI startup; this enables leveraging abundant human video data
- Defensibility: 3/5 - Research is public but data collection and scale create moat
- Adoption: 4/5 - Apache 2.0 license, HuggingFace integration, 9.8K GitHub stars

**Decision Rationale:** High-impact finding from leading robotics startup. The emergent alignment insight reduces the perceived complexity of human-to-robot transfer from "fundamental research challenge" to "scaling problem." Commercial validation through Physical Intelligence's real-world deployments. Strong author team (Finn, Levine, Nair from Stanford/Berkeley robotics).

**Extracted Insights:**
- Human-to-robot transfer emerges naturally with diverse VLA pretraining—no explicit alignment needed
- Pretraining diversity is the key variable: models lacking diverse training show negligible transfer
- Co-training on human video nearly doubles OOD generalization (32%→71% on some tasks)
- T-SNE shows human/robot embeddings naturally align as diversity increases

**Cross-References:**
- Related to: arxiv_2601.02456 (InternVLA-A1) - different architecture but both explore scaling VLAs with diverse data
- Related to: arxiv_2512.22615 (Dream-VLA) - both advance VLA architecture frontier
- Related to: π0.5 paper (arxiv 2504.16054) - this paper contributes to that system's data strategy

**Learnings for Future Iterations:**
- Physical Intelligence is the dominant commercial player in VLA space ($5.6B valuation); track their releases closely
- "Emergence" framing connects robotics to LLM scaling insights—may see more such crossover
- Human video data is potentially transformative for robotics if collection/processing can scale

## 2026-01-14 - Paper: LaST₀: Latent Spatio-Temporal Chain-of-Thought for Robotic Vision-Language-Action Model
ID: arxiv_2601.05248
Status: PRESENTED
Score: 21/30

**Summary:** Introduces LaST₀, a VLA framework using latent spatio-temporal chain-of-thought reasoning instead of explicit linguistic or visual predictions. Key innovation: reasoning happens in a compact latent space that captures "ineffable physical attributes" difficult to verbalize, achieving 82% simulation success and 72% real-world success.

**Key Method:** Dual-system Mixture-of-Transformers architecture:
- **Slow reasoning expert:** Autoregressively predicts three interleaved latent modalities (visual via SigLIP, geometric via Uni3D, proprioceptive) at keyframes
- **Fast acting expert:** High-frequency action generation conditioned on latent representations
- **Asynchronous coordination:** Fixed ratio κ (2/4/8) decouples operating frequencies; KV caching eliminates redundant computation

Three-stage training: (1) Large-scale pretraining on 400K+ trajectories from Open-X/DROID/RoboMIND, (2) SFT of slow expert with cosine similarity loss (40 epochs), (3) Action expert training with flow matching (300 epochs). Built on DeepSeek-LLM 1B initialized from Janus-Pro.

**Implementation Check:**
- GitHub repos: no (GitHub API search returned no results)
- Project website: https://sites.google.com/view/last0
- Commercial use: no public evidence found
- Open questions: When will code/weights be released? How does latent CoT compare to explicit visual foresight (InternVLA-A1) on dynamic tasks?

**Score Breakdown:**
- Novelty: 4/5 - Latent CoT is meaningful architectural innovation over explicit linguistic/visual reasoning
- Feasibility: 4/5 - Built on proven backbones; 400K trajectory pretraining is substantial but achievable
- Time-to-POC: 3/5 - No code released yet; requires multi-camera setup and Gello teleoperation
- Value/Market: 4/5 - 13% real-world improvement + 5× long-horizon robustness addresses key deployment gaps
- Defensibility: 3/5 - Novel architecture but builds on public components
- Adoption: 3/5 - No public code/weights yet; 15.4Hz inference on RTX 4090 is practical

**Decision Rationale:** Strong VLA contribution with novel latent reasoning approach that achieves both quality improvement (13% real-world gain) and speed improvement (14× over explicit CoT). Long-horizon robustness (5× at final steps) is particularly valuable for practical deployment.

**Extracted Insights:**
- Latent CoT captures "ineffable physical attributes" that explicit linguistic reasoning cannot, enabling 14× speedup while improving performance
- Asynchronous frequency coordination with KV caching enables efficient dual-expert VLAs at 15.4Hz
- Long-horizon robustness improves dramatically (5× at final steps) with latent spatio-temporal reasoning

**Cross-References:**
- Related to: arxiv_2601.02456 (InternVLA-A1) - explicit visual foresight vs latent CoT; both use MoT architecture
- Related to: arxiv_2512.22615 (Dream-VLA) - diffusion backbone vs latent reasoning; both achieve speedup over autoregressive
- Related to: arxiv_2601.03590 (SiT-Bench) - both explore alternatives to explicit linguistic spatial reasoning

**Learnings for Future Iterations:**
- "Latent" vs "explicit" reasoning is emerging as key VLA architecture decision; track papers comparing these approaches
- Long-horizon robustness is differentiating metric—not just single-step success rate
- Janus-Pro (DeepSeek multimodal) is becoming popular foundation for VLAs alongside InternVL and Qwen
